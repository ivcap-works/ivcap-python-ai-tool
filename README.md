# IVCAP "AI Tool" Demo

> __Note:__ This is template repository to help you get started with building a new service for the IVCAP platform. If you are still unfamilar with
IVCAP, you may want to first checkout the [Gene Ontology (GO) Term Mapper](https://github.com/ivcap-works/gene-onology-term-mapper) tutorial.

This repo template contains an implementation of a
basic _AI Agent Tool_ usable for various agent frameworks
like [crewAI](https://www.crewai.com).

The actual tool implemented in ths repo provides a simple test if a provided
number is a prime number or not.

## Use <a name="test"></a>

Below is an example of an agent query which uses this tool:
```
{
  "$schema": "urn:sd-core:schema:llama-agent.request.1",
  "name": "Agent query test",
  "msg": "is 997 a prime number?",
  "tools": [
    "urn:sd-core:ai-tool:is_prime"
  ],
  "verbose": true
}
```

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
1. Install `poetry` and add the `ivcap` plugin:
   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   poetry self add poetry-plugin-ivcap
   ```
1. Install the IVCAP cli tool. Instructions can be found [following this link](https://github.com/ivcap-works/ivcap-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#install-released-binaries).
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install --no-root
   ```

## Test <a name="test"></a>

In order to quickly test this service, follow these steps:

* `poetry ivcap run`

```
% poetry ivcap run
Running: poetry run python tool-service.py --port 8078
2025-05-28T16:24:14+1000 INFO (app): AI tool to check for prime numbers - 0.2.0|b4dbd44|2025-05-28T16:24:13+10:00 - v0.7.2
2025-05-28T16:24:14+1000 INFO (uvicorn.error): Started server process [6311]

2025-05-28T16:24:14+1000 INFO (uvicorn.error): Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8078 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

In a separate terminal, call the service via `make test-local` or your favorite http testing tool:
```
% make test-local
curl -i -X POST \
    -H "content-type: application/json" \
    --data @tests/request.json \
    http://localhost:8078
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
date: Tue, 22 Jul 2025 06:32:39 GMT
server: uvicorn
job-id: urn:ivcap:job:1f066c5a-a3b4-6f84-a5f7-9eae9cc90b25
content-length: 67
content-type: application/json
ivcap-ai-tool-version: 0.7.15

{"$schema":"urn:sd:schema.is-prime.1","number":997,"is_prime":true}
```

A more "web friendly" way is to open [http://localhost:8078/api](http://localhost:8078/api)

## Build & Deploy <a name="build"></a>

The tool needs to be packed into a docker container, and the, together with an IVCAP service description
deployed to an IVCAP platform.

> **Important**: If you adopt this repo template, please make sure to first change the first two variables
`SERVICE_NAME` and `SERVICE_TITLE` at the top of the [Makefile](./Makefile).


> **Note:** Please make sure to have the IVCAP cli tool installed and configured. See the
[ivcap-cli](https://github.com/ivcap-works/ivcap-cli) repo for more details.

## Deploying to Platform

> For a more in-depth description, please refer to [Step 8: Deploying to IVCAP](https://github.com/ivcap-works/gene-onology-term-mapper?tab=readme-ov-file#step-8-deploying-to-ivcap-) in the [Gene Ontology (GO) Term Mapper](https://github.com/ivcap-works/gene-onology-term-mapper) tutorial.

Deployment is a three step process:
1. Building and deploying the docker image
1. Registering the service
1. Registering the tool description

All this can be accomplished with a single command:

```
poetry ivcap deploy
```


### Test deployed Service

Run `poetry ivcap job-exec tests/request.json` to execute the service to check if '997' is a prime number (`{"number": 997}`):

```
% poetry ivcap job-exec tests/request.json
...
Creating job 'https://develop.ivcap.net/1/services2/urn:ivcap:service:3c51bd86-..../jobs'
{
  "$schema": "urn:sd:schema.is-prime.1",
  "is_prime": true,
  "number": 997
}
```

## Implementation <a name="implementation"></a>

### [tool-service.py](./tool-service.py)

Implements a simple http based service which provides a `POST /` service endpoint to test
if the number contained in the request is a prime number or not.

We first import a few library functionss and configure the logging system to use a more "machine" friendly format to simplify service monitoring on the platform.

```
import math
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict

from ivcap_service import getLogger, Service
from ivcap_ai_tool import start_tool_server, ToolOptions, ivcap_ai_tool, logging_init

logging_init()
logger = getLogger("app")
```

We then describe the service, who to contact and other useful information used whne deploying the service

```
service = Service(
    name="AI tool to check for prime numbers",
    contact={
        "name": "Max Ott",
        "email": "max.ott@data61.csiro.au",
    },
    license={
        "name": "MIT",
        "url": "https://opensource.org/license/MIT",
    },
)
```

The core function of the tool itself is accessible as `POST /`. The service signature should be kept as simple as possible.
We highly recommend defining the input as well as the result by a single `pydantic` model, respectively.
However, for a tool to be properly used by an Agent, we should provide a
comprehensive function documentation including the required parameters as well as the reply.

Please also note the `@ivcap_ai_tool` decorator. It exposes the service via `POST \`, but also a `GET /`
to allow the platform to obtain the tool description which can be used by agents to select the right
tool but also understand on how to use it.

```
class Request(BaseModel):
    jschema: str = Field("urn:sd:schema:is-prime.request.1", alias="$schema")
    number: int = Field(description="the number to check if prime")

class Result(BaseModel):
    jschema: str = Field("urn:sd:schema:is-prime.1", alias="$schema")
    flag: bool = Field(description="true if number is prime, false otherwise")

@ivcap_ai_tool("/", opts=ToolOptions(tags=["Prime Checker"]))
def is_prime(req: Request) -> Result:
    """
    Checks if a number is a prime number.
    """
    ...
    return Result(flag=True)
```

Finally, we need to start the server
to listen for incoming requests:

```
# Start server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_tool_server(service)
```

## [resources.json](./resources.json)

This file contains the resource requirements for this tool. This will depend on the computational and memory
requirements for the specific tool. If it is not provided a default will be used which is likely very similar
to this file.

- GPU support

   Adding `"nvidia.com/gpu": 1` into the resources.json file, would allocate a NVIDIA-T4 GPU
